# Visa Bulletins Analysis
The backend is a Python app that pulls data from the official [visa bulletin website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html), which focuses on China and India employment-based immigration in categories 2 and 3. The purpose of this app is to help Chinese and India employment-based immigrants to analyze the movements of their priority dates, since these categories have the largest backlog.

Big thanks to [Sandro Tosi's Python script](https://github.com/sandrotosi/uscis-visa-bulletin/blob/master/parse_uscis_bulletin_pages.py), which helped me to understand how to parse the data from the bulletin webpages. 

I also plan to build a frontend to visualize the data, for easier analysis.
